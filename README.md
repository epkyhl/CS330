# CS330

### Summary
I rather enjoyed working on this project overall. It may have not been the easiest of the CS concepts to learn and use, but the results were above my expectations for just starting to learn the topic. It was enjoyable to experiment with positions and textures and finding a way to make it all blend together into one cohesive image. There was absolutely more I could have done given more time on the project, but for this being the base without an extrordinary amount of time dedicated to just the project, I am very happy with the results.

### Reflection
I always remember hearing the best way to create and implement software is little bits at a time and thought it probably is not as important as everyone says. While I still may not do as small of incriments as I should, this project showed me just why that is. There were a couple times where I had made multiple changes to a shape, overdid one of them, and had a difficult time figuring out which of the changes was the one I overdid. I found it much easier to make one, maybe two changes and check my work rather than trying to make multiple and troubleshoot from there. I would say this project has gotten me more in line with accepting trial and error as a development strategy, especially for personal projects. A big part of this field is debugging, so it being a core part of my approach I think will be quite useful to me.
